--Pipelining Assembly Language Instructions
This project implements a basic pipelining system for executing assembly language instructions. It reads instructions from an input file, converts them into machine code, and simulates the pipeline execution. The code is written in C++.

--Prerequisites :
C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or above) and 
Input file containing assembly language instructions.


The program will read the input file, convert the assembly instructions to machine code, and simulate the pipeline execution.

Input File Format
The input file should contain assembly language instructions, with each instruction on a separate line. The supported instructions include:

Make sure the input file follows the correct syntax and format for assembly instructions.

Output :
The program will display the machine code representation of each instruction, followed by the simulated pipeline execution. The pipeline execution will show the stages of the pipeline (fetch, decode, execute, memory, writeback) for each instruction.
